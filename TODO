- make spectrogram methods agnostic to input type (i.e., they should operate on
  any complex array
- optimize point process methods: arrays can be quite sparse. at the least,
  avoid overhead of moving data in and out of numpy arrays
- consider replacing cython with pybind11 for more flexible type handling
- consider dropping C api
